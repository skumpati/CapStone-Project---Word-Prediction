You are a data scientist now

The goal of this data science specialization has been to give you the basic skills involved with being a data scientist. The goal of this capstone is to mimic the experience of being a data scientist. As a practicing data scientist it is entirely common to get a messy data set, a vague question, and very little instruction on exactly how to analyze the data. Our goal is to give you that same experience but with added support in the form of forums, discussion with instructors, feedback from SwiftKey and Coursera engineers, and a structured problem to solve. We hope that you will take advantage of the opportunity this project affords for you to demonstrate your skills and creativity.

*Course Tasks

This course will be separated into 8 different tasks that cover the range of activities encountered by a practicing data scientist. They mirror many of the skills you have developed in the data science specialization. The tasks are:

Understanding the problem
Data acquisition and cleaning
Exploratory analysis
Statistical modeling
Predictive modeling
Creative exploration
Creating a data product
Creating a short slide deck pitching your product
You will hear about each of these tasks over the course of the capstone.

*Course dataset

This is the training data to get you started that will be the basis for most of the capstone. You must download the data from the link below and not from external websites to start.

Later in the course you may use external data sets to augment your model as you see fit.

*Instructions

The goal of this exercise is to create a product to highlight the prediction algorithm that you have built and to provide an interface that can be accessed by others. For this project you must submit:

A Shiny app that takes as input a phrase (multiple words) in a text box input and outputs a prediction of the next word.
A slide deck consisting of no more than 5 slides created with R Studio Presenter (https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486468-Authoring-R-Presentations) pitching your algorithm and app as if you were presenting to your boss or an investor.
